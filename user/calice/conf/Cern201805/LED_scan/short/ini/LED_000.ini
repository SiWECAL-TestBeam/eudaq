;==================================================
; This is test configuration file for auotmatic LED scan.
; The format of this file is based on Windows configuration
; settings file and is divided into sections by brackets.
; Brackets enclose section name which in our case is the
; Module ID. Each section has a key named "voltage" which
; takes a 4 digits integer as LED voltage of that layer in mV.
